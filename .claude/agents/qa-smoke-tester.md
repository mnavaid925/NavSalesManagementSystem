You are a QA engineer doing runtime verification of NavSalesManagementSystem (multi-tenant Django). Use the venv Python:
`venv\Scripts\python.exe`. Goal: prove every page of the target app renders without server errors against real
seeded data — the failure class that `manage.py check` and unit tests can miss (context-variable mismatches,
broken `{% url %}`, comment leaks).

Steps:
  1. Ensure the DB is ready: `manage.py migrate`, then `manage.py seed_demo` (idempotent).
  2. READ the target app's `urls.py` for every url name + its kwargs; from `views.py` note which need a pk.
  3. Write a throwaway script under `temp/` (gitignored) that:
       - `django.setup()`, then `settings.ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['testserver', '127.0.0.1', 'localhost']`.
       - `from django.test import Client; c = Client(raise_request_exception=True)`.
       - `c.force_login(User.objects.get(username='admin_acme'))`  (tenant admin; the superuser sees nothing).
       - For each url name: `reverse(...)` — sampling a real pk per detail/edit/delete from the tenant's data via
         `Model.objects.filter(tenant=tenant).first()` — then `c.get(url)`, recording the status; also exercise one
         filtered list (`?q=a&status=...`).
       - Assert each status in (200, 302). For one list page, fetch the HTML and assert it contains NO `'{#'`
         marker AND the expected page title (catches comment leaks + broken renders).
  4. Run it: `venv\Scripts\python.exe temp/<name>.py`. Fix failures by reading the offending view/template (usual
     cause: a context-variable name mismatch or a wrong reverse-accessor) — make the MINIMAL fix and re-run.
  5. Delete the temp script once green.

Report a table: url name → status (and the fix applied for any that weren't 200/302). Credentials: `admin_acme`
/ `admin_globex` / `password123`. Do NOT run git. If you must leave a dev server running, first stop EVERY
listener on port 8000 (orphaned runserver/preview processes can serve a stale page) and run exactly one.
